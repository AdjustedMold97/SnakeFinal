# SnakeFinal

This is a simple snake game that we've been working on for a little while. Here's a brief rundown of the version history in this repository.

---Snake 2.0 (refactored)---

This code is based off of the code found in this: (https://github.com/MrNeonMan123/Brandon/blob/master/Snake%202.0.zip) repository. It has near identical functionality, but I find the refactored version much easier to read in several ways.

---Snake 2.1---
(this is the most recent version to-date)

This version added a significant number of additional features, namely user selection of different settings. Specifically, it added various map sizes, speeds which alter difficulty, and a setting which gradually increases the speed of the snake, as well as some user-friendly UI improvements.

---Future Plans---
I plan on adding a database which will store a username and a list of high scores, as well as a built in function to view the high scores as an addition to the UI. I will upload this as Snake 2.2
