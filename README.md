# SnakeFinal

This is a simple snake game that we've been working on for a little while. Here's a brief rundown of the version history in this repository.

# Snake 2.0 (refactored)

This code is based off of the code found in this: (https://github.com/MrNeonMan123/Brandon/blob/master/Snake%202.0.zip) repository. It has near identical functionality, but I find the refactored version much easier to read in several ways.

# Snake 2.1

This version added a significant number of additional features, namely user selection of different settings. Specifically, it added various map sizes, speeds which alter difficulty, and a setting which gradually increases the speed of the snake, as well as some user-friendly UI improvements.

# Snake 2.2

(most recent version)

I had to upload this as a compressed zip file, as it included a slew of new files that came along with adding a SqlServer database to the equation. I added functionality which allows a user to enter a 3 character username which records their score, and a method (albeit unimplemented) that allows a user to read the top 10 scores to the console. I'm not sure if the database will work for other users, however, as the connection string has a path specific to the files in MY pc.

# Future Plans

I'm currently working on Snake 2.3, which is going to have some UI improvements, refactorings within the code, and some much deserved cleaning.
